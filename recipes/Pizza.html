<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Neapolitan pizza is a type of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. It consists of thin dough, and its toppings typically include tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. You can also try different pizza topping combinations. A wood-fired oven is suitable for cooking Neapolitan pizza, giving it a unique flavor. You can check our guide on buying the best indoor pizza ovens for home use.</p>

<p>One of its defining characteristics is that there is often more sauce than cheese. This leaves the middle of the pie wet or soggy and not conducive to being served by the slice. Because of this, Neapolitan pizzas are generally pretty small (about 10 to 12 inches), making them closer to the size of a personal pizza. Neapolitan pizzas are also cooked at very high temperatures (800 F to 900 F) for no more than 90 seconds</p>

<h2>Fun Facts about Neapolitan Pizza Margherita!</h2>

 
<ul>

    <li>The <strong>pizza margherita recipe</strong> was invented in <em>1889 in honour of Margherita of Savoy, the Queen of Italy</em></li>
    
    <p> It was made by the chef <em>Raffaele Esposito</em> of the Brandi pizzeria, with ingredients representing the <em>colors of the Italian flag</em>. Several scholars believe that its origins are far older and that its name comes from the flower, daisy (<strong>margherita</strong> in Italian), because of the way the mozzarella was laid out. </p>
    
  
    <li>Naples was the <strong>birhtplace</strong> of the pizza </li>
    
    <p> Napoli sits on the southwest coast of Italy and is the third-largest urban municipality in the country.

        Modern pizza originated in <strong>1760s Naples</strong>, although documentation of the word pizza dates back to  <em> 997 A.D</em>. in central Italy.
        
        So you may have wondered,<em>“What city has the best pizza in the world?</em>”
        
        Naples, of course!
        
        In the <strong>18th century</strong>, poor Italian residents started adding tomatoes to their flatbread, and modern-day pizza was born.</p>

    <li><strong>True Neapolitan Pizza Association</strong> was founded <em>In 1984</em> to protect the integrity of the traditional and beloved pizza Napoletana.</li>
   
    <p>The Association created <em>strict rules for crafting a proper Neapolitan pizza</em>.

        This includes hand kneading the dough, with no mechanical mixing equipment that should be used, but they are.
        
        The shaping pizza into a circle less than <em>35 centimeters in diameter</em> and no more than three millimeters thick at its center.
        
        In addition, it must be a wood-fired pizza prepared in a domed oven.</p>

    <li>The Difference is in the <em>Ingredients!</em></li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>250 g pizza dough</p></li>

<li><p>80 g peeled tomatoes</p></li>

<li><p>80 g fiordilatte mozzarella</p></li>

<li><p>basil leaves</p></li>

<li><p>extra-virgin olive oil</p></li>

<li><p>salt</p></li>

<li><p>Fresh Basil for serving</p></li>

</ul>




<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

    <li><p>Place dough balls on a baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours. (This will make it easier to stretch.)</p></li>


    <li><p>Preheat oven to 525°F with racks in uppermost and lowest positions. Lightly flour a work surface. Place 1 dough ball on surface (leave second ball covered); turn to coat in flour. Press firmly with fingertips and palm to flatten to an 8-inch round, starting from the center and working toward the edge. With hands at 10 and 2 o’clock, lift dough and rotate, moving hands around the edge, letting dough stretch to a 10-inch round. Transfer to a baking sheet.</p></li>


    <li><p>Spread 2 tablespoons crushed tomatoes over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and top with half the cheese.</p></li>


    <li><p>Bake on lower rack until bottom of crust is browned (use a spatula to peek underneath), 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to top rack; increase oven temperature to broil. Watching closely, broil until crust is lightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven; top with basil.</p></li>
   
    <li><p>Repeat with remaining dough and toppings.</p></li>
