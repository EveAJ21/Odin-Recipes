    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Made from a variety of corn or maize</strong>) is a traditional soup or stew from Mexican cuisine. It is made from <em>hominy with meat (typically pork, but possibly chicken)</em>, and can be seasoned and garnished with shredded lettuce or <em>cabbage, chile peppers, onion, garlic, radishes, avocado, salsa or limes</em>. Known in Mesoamerica since the <em>pre-Columbian era</em>, today the stew is common across Mexico and neighboring countries, and is served both as a day-to-day meal and as a festive dish.</p>
  

    <p>Pozole can be prepared in many ways, but all variations include <strong>a base of cooked hominy in broth</strong>. Typically pork, or sometimes chicken, is included in the base. Vegetarian recipes substitute beans for the meat.

        <em>The three main types of pozole are blanco (white), verde (green) and rojo (red)</em> White pozole is the preparation without any additional green or red sauce. Green pozole adds a rich sauce based on green ingredients, possibly including <em>tomatillos, epazote, cilantro, jalapeños, or pepitas. Red pozole is made without the green sauce, instead adding a red sauce made from one or more chiles, such as guajillo, piquin, or ancho</em>.</p>


<h2>The Roots and Rituals of Pozole</h2>

<p>Today, you can find a bowl of pozole at many carnicerias or familias’ tables, but it was originally regarded as a meal for the privileged elite of the Aztec empire. A bit similarly to how it’s served today, the dish was often made for special occasions.
    
    For the Mexicas, the <em>Nahuatl-speaking indigenous people of the Valley of Mexico</em> who were the rulers of the Aztec Empire, these pozole occasions were to celebrate:  <strong>gods, good harvests and changing seasons</strong>.
    
    In honor of Tláloc, the god of rain and rain deities, Aztecs held a festival during February and March known as <em>Atlcahualo</em>—to usher in the rain needed for planting. Soon after Atlcahualo came the feast of Tlacaxipehualiztli , celebrating the year’s harvest and commemorating how the Mexica obtained and inherited corn from the Toltecs.</p>

  
   
    <p>During <em>Tlacaxipehualiztli</em> every spring, the year’s harvest was sown and ears of corn were offered to <strong>Xipe Tótec</strong>, “<em>the god of the renewal of vegetation in the spring</em> (i.e., as a fertility figure), as a god of liberation (i.e., particularly, as a penitential figure), as the central figure in a cult of ‘trophy skins,’ … even as a phallic god,</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Fun Facts about Pozole</h2>

    <ul>
        
        <li>Pozole was mentioned in the <strong>16th century</strong> <em>Florentine Codex by Bernardino de Sahagún</em></li>
          
        <p>Since maize was a sacred plant for the Aztecs and other inhabitants of Mesoamerica, pozole was made to be consumed on special occasions.According to research by the National Institute of Anthropology and History on these special occasions, the meat used in the pozole may have been human. Possible archeological evidence of mass cannibalism may support this theory, though many other explanations for this evidence have been proposed, and no eyewitness accounts of Aztec cannibalism are known to exist</p>


        <li> The name pozole originates from<strong>Nahuatl</strong> – <em>pozolé, pozolli or pasole</em>,</li>
        
        <p>which some claim means ‘hominy’ and others say means ‘frothy’ – and remains most popular in states that have the most common variations on it, such as Jalisco (whose red pozole is the most well-known), Guerrero (which uses green tomatoes in the broth) and both the State and City of Mexico. However, it’s also typical in Michoacán (where chicharrón is added),</p>

 <h2>Directions</h2>

 <ol>


    <li><p>The first step we must carry out for the preparation of this delicious red Pozole is to put the water in a large pot and take to the fire. Then we must add the peeled garlic cloves and the onion, washed, peeled and cut into quarters. Both the pork and the ribs will be cleaned very well and cut into cubes. Then we will also add them to the pot. We will keep this over high heat until it starts to boil.</p></li>


    <li><p>When we see that it is already boiling, we will lower the heat to low total, and let the meats cook for about 2 and a half hours or so. Or also until we see that the meat and ribs are well cooked. We will know that the ribs are ready because we will notice how the meat comes off the bone. It is important that during this cooking time we remove the fat and foam that will form on the surface.</p></li>


    <li><p>We should also try to maintain the same level of broth in the pot during the process. So, if necessary, you can add (hot) water when you notice that it is reduced too much. Once the meat is ready, we will separate it from the broth. We will also remove from the broth the excess fat, the bones of the ribs, the garlic and the onion. This step is important so that the red Pozole is not too greasy.Now let's go with the sauce</p></li>


        <li><p>To do this, we must soak the chili peppers (all) in enough water. The water should cover them all and we should leave them there for about 25 minutes or so. While that time passes, we are going to peel the garlic cloves, we can cut them in half. The half onion will be peeled and cut into small squares. Once the chilies are soft, we will take them to the blender glass. Add the garlic, the chopped onion and the oregano. We will also pour a splash of the water in which we soak the chilies.</p></li>


        <li><p>Liquefy until all the ingredients are well crushed and integrated. The idea is to get a sauce of mild consistency. The measure of oil that we have in the list for the sauce, we are going to put it to the medium – high heat. When it is hot, we will add the sauce that we have liquefied and a little salt to taste. We must constantly stir so that it does not jump too much. Then we will bring to low heat and let it cook for about 25 minutes or so. This will be the red Pozole sauce, which you can add more hot peppers if you wish.</p></li>


        <li><p>After that time, we will pass the sauce through a strainer, so that it is free of pieces. Then we are going to add it to the pot where we have the broth in which we cook the meat. We will light the medium heat and wait for it to start boiling. When it does, we will add the meats. Let it boil again over low heat for about 10 minutes. Finally, we will add the pozolero corn and a little salt and pepper to taste. We will continue cooking until everything is well integrated and cooked completely or to our liking. The pozolero corn will already be soft, so then we will turn off the fire and that's it. We can serve accompanied by the ingredients from the garnish list. And profit.</p></li>
