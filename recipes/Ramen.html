    <h2>Fun Facts about Ramen!</h2>


  <ul>

    <li>The first ramen shop opened in Tokyo in <strong>1910</strong>.</li>
     <p> 
        <em>In 1910, Japan’s first dedicated ramen shop, Rairaiken,

        </em> opened at Asukasa, Tokyo. Its Japanese owner employed a dozen Cantonese cooks from Yokohama Chinatown to serve ramen that matched the Japanese palate.
     </p>
    
    
   
    <li> 
        Ramen originated <strong> from China</strong>.
      <p>
        If you’ve read the list of interesting Japanese food facts, you probably already know that<em>ramen isn’t originally from Japan</em>. Like many noodle dishes, <em>it has roots in China</em>.

It is widely believed that ramen was introduced by Chinese immigrants in the late <strong>19th or early 20th</strong> century at Yokohoma Chinatown.

Until the 1950s, it was called <em>shina soba or Chinese-style noodle soup</em>. Later, the Japanese started calling it <strong>“ramen”</strong>, a Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese lamian.
      </p>

    </li>
    
     
    <li> 
        The instant ramen noodle was invented in <strong>1958</strong>.
    <p>
        Love instant ramen? You have Momofuku Ando to thank for.

        The founder of Nissin Food spent an entire year researching and perfecting his flash-frying method as a response to the food shortage in post-war Japan. <em>After a series of trials and errors, he eventually came up with the</em> <strong>instant ramen</strong>, Chikin Ramen, on August 25, 1958. 
    </p>
</li>

    <li>
        Instant noodles are the first type of noodles to be eaten in space
     
        <p> A couple of years before his death, Momofuku Ando and Nissin made history again by inventing <em>“Space Ram”</em>, a space-viable, vacuum-sealed package of ramen.

        The Space Ram had smaller noodles but was based on the recipe of Chickin Ramen. To avoid spilling in zero-gravity, the broth was thicker than usual.
        
       <em>Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi packed and ate this ramen on the second day of his journey</em> aboard the space shuttle Discovery.

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Combine water, garlic, ginger, and onion in a large stock pot and bring broth base to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain an easy simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
   
    <li><p>While broth simmers, fill a saucepan with water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer. Lower eggs into the water 1 at a time. Cook 7 minutes for barely set yolks. Remove eggs from hot water, run under cold water until cool, and peel. Halve eggs lengthwise, place on a plate, and season with salt and pepper.</p></li>
   
    <li><p>A large pot with water and bring to a boil in preparation for cooking noodles. Reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
   
    <li><p> A slotted spoon or long-handled strainer to remove garlic, ginger, and onion from the broth in the stock pot after it has simmered 40 minutes. Discard vegetables. Add soy sauce, sake, chile sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and salt and stir well. Cover stock pot loosely and simmer 10 to 20 minutes more.</p></li>
   
    <li><p>Return simmering water to a boil. Add noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain and divide noodles between 4 large bowls.</p></li>
   
    <li><p>Add shrimp and scallops to the simmering broth. Cook until opaque, 3 to 5 minutes</p></li>
   
    <li><p>Ladle finished broth into bowls to barely cover noodles. Add equal amounts of shrimp and 1 scallop to the center of each bowl. Place a portion of bean sprouts on the side of each bowl. Place 2 soft-boiled egg halves, yolks up, resting on noodles in each bowl; keep eggs above the broth. Garnish each bowl with scallions.</p></li>
